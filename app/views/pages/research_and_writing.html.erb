      <p>This study was a qualitative auto-ethnographic life history study, meaning that the researchers were the participants.  Collectively and with the support of a third-party data collector, questions about the interactive role between leisure participation and religious affiliation were explored in a group discussion format.  The study revealed many ways in which spirituality might impact leisure behavior.  We presented our findings at the Northeastern Recreation Research Symposium in 2011, a scholarly conference for recreation and leisure studies.</p>
