  	<p>I have extensive experience in the teaching field dating back to my time as an undergraduate student in Health and Human Performance Education.  Most recently, I served as a temporary member of the physical education faculty at Westminster College in Fulton, MO.</p>

  	<h4>Health and Physical Education Instructor</h4>
  	<p><em>Westminster College</em></p>

  	<p>I accepted a contract on the physical education faculty at Westminster College for Fall 2011 to Spring 2012.  As an instructor, I had five primary objectives: 1) promoting transformative practices in physical education; 2) emphasizing hands-on, authentic learning experiences; 3) reinforcing reading, information literacy, and independent study skills; 4) enhancing courses with community and web resources; and 5) regularly communicating with students about expectations and progress.</p>

  	<p>Below is a list of courses that I taught and their descriptions, with select attachments.</p>

  	<p><strong>Courses:</strong></p>

  	  <div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns">
	    <p><strong>History and Philosophy of P.E. & Sport</strong> (Fall 2011)</p>

	    <p>This course introduces students to the historical and philosophical foundations of sport and physical education, with particular emphasis on contextual perspectives in regards to pedagogy.  The course will provide a background in world history and classical philosophies to empower interdisciplinary and multicultural perspectives that will facilitate discussions of theoretical and practical issues in contemporary physical education and sport.</p>

	    <p><strong>Elementary Health Education Methods</strong> (Fall 2011)</p>

	    <p>This course examines the principles of teaching health, physical fitness, and safety for wellness and optimal development focusing on the needs of children.</p>

	    <p><strong>Measurement and Evaluation of P.E. & Sport </strong> (Fall 2011)</p>

	    <p>This course will examine various tools of measurement and analyze the purposes, values, and limitations of measurement tools in relation to objectives.  Methods will be applied to a variety of professional areas, such as teaching, athletic training/rehabilitation, biomechanics, and exercise physiology.</p>

	    <p><strong>Elementary Physical Education Methods</strong> (Spring 2012)</p>

	    <p>By identifying patterns of growth and development, students will be able to develop methods to successfully teach fundamental movement skills and physical education concepts through quality instruction, games, dance, health-related fitness and perceptual-motor activities.  Practicum is included.  This course is required for K-12 Physical Education majors.</p>

	    <p><strong>Adapted Physical Education </strong> (Spring 2012)</p>

	    <p>This course is designed to identify the symptomatology, typical behavioral aberrations, sources of referral, and principles and challenges related to physical education of the student with special needs.  Instruction is directed to modifying motor and general fitness activities so that a learning environment suitable to persons with special needs and capabilities is developed.  Directed practicum experience is included.</p>	

	    <p><strong>Boffer Fighting and Medieval Roleplay</strong> (Spring 2012, experimental physical activity course)</p>

	    <p>This activity course teaches students how to play an alternative sport, live-action fantasy role–play (LARP) boffer fighting, following the current edition of the Amtgard rulebook. Through fast-paced but safe combat simulation students develop fitness and athletic ability, exercise the flexible and creative possibilities that alternative game structures allow, and learn combat strategies across many unique scenarios. Students explore basic sport and recreational constructs within this context, as well as the integration of unique constructs such as fantasy, narration, theater, and historical elements throughout athletic events.</p><br />
